"summary_en": "Aaron Ginn argues for “AI realism,” a pragmatic middle path between doomers and zealots. He says both extremes rely on sci-fi beliefs that AI will surpass and escape human control. Intelligence isn’t a fixed, measurable finish line; AI should be treated as a tool that amplifies people. Policy should invest in infrastructure, talent and open-source while rejecting fear-driven bans.",
"summary_zh": "作者提出“AI现实主义”，反对把AI神化或魔化的两极化叙事。文章认为，所谓“AGI 超越人类”是科幻式预设；智能并非可精确衡量的终点。AI应被视为放大人类能力的工具，而非神祇或恶魔。政策上主张投入基础设施、人才与开源，避免以恐惧为导向的禁令。",
